# Archived Documents

These are the original monolith documents created on 2026-02-02 during the initial planning phase of the Lunar Reminder App.

## Why Archived?

These files have been superseded by the modular documentation structure:

| Archived File | Canonical Replacement |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `01_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` | `docs/requirements/` + `openspec/specs/capabilities/` |
| `02_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` | `docs/architecture/` + `docs/api/` + `docs/features/` |
| `04_DATA_MODEL.md` | `docs/data-model/` |
| `CHANGE_HISTORY.md` | `docs/changelog/` |

## Rules

- **DO NOT edit** these files — they are preserved for historical reference only
- **DO NOT reference** these files in new documentation — use the canonical locations above
- For the complete documentation hub, see [`docs/index.md`](../index.md)

## Archive Date
2026-02-05 — See `docs/process/REORGANIZATION_CHANGELOG.md` for details.
